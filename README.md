# 🧾 Personal Data Form (HTML5 Assignment)

This project is a simple **HTML5 form** designed as part of an assignment to practice using **semantic HTML elements** such as:
`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, and `<footer>`.

## 📄 Project Description

The page displays a **personal data registration form** where users can fill in:
- Name (First and Second)
- Contact details (Phone, Password)
- Gender (Male/Female)
- University (with `<optgroup>` support)
- Status (Student / Graduated)

All elements are styled using **inline CSS only** without any external stylesheet — keeping the design clean and minimal.
